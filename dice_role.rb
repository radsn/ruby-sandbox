# Write a program that:

# generates a random guess for a dice roll (a number between 1 and 6)
# generates another random dice roll (a number between 1 and 6).

# if the guess is right, your program should print:

#   "You guessed correctly."
# if the guess is not right, your program should print:

#   "Sorry, you guessed X. The die landed on Y." 
# (where X is the random guess and Y is the roll)

player_guess = rand(1..6)
computer_roll = rand(1..6)
if player_guess == computer_roll
  pp "You guessed correctly."
else
  pp  "Sorry, you guessed #{player_guess}. The die landed on #{computer_roll}."
end
